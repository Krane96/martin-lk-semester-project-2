## Description
The goal with this was to:
- Make an fully responsive e-commerce website with semantic and neat design.
- Successfully login using jwt tokens from a strapi user which redirects you to an admin page where only authorized users can do things.
- Update, create, post and delete products from the Admin page.
- Search filter for the list of products.

E-commerce site made by with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This was a school project and has some features missing that were not part of the tasks. Strapi was used as an API to get products/users and local storage to save it.

## Built with
- Vanilla JS, HTML and Sass
